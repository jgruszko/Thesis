@article{Mullowney2012,
	Abstract = {In the crystal bulk of group IV covalent semiconductors such as germanium (Ge), simple analytic models for the valence band structure can provide fast, accurate computations of hole mobility for moderate energy ranges up to a few eV. On the surfaces of these materials, such as on Ge-vacuum or Ge-GeO 2 interfaces, the transport rates differ significantly from the bulk. This can be problematic for both point contact and segmented Ge gamma ray detectors, that require accurate carrier drift rates for computing signal basis sets, which themselves are necessary for the precise determination of gamma-ray induced compton scattering events. While several techniques exist for computing surface hole mobilities, more often than not, these methods are complex to implement, require significant computational resources, and lack the simplicity of bulk models for interpreting results. This paper presents a new technique for computing Ge surface hole mobility that can give a first estimate for the surface transport rates after tuning a physically based computational parameter. This model is used in conjunction with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for modeling hole-dynamics inside a Ge p-type point contact detector. The results of our calculations agree with experimental data gathered from Ge p-type point contact detectors at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.},

	Abstract = {SNO+ will search for neutrinoless double beta decay by loading 780 tonnes of linear alkylbenzene liquid scintillator with O(tonne) of neodymium. Using natural Nd at 0.1% loading will provide 43.7 kg of 150Nd given its 5.6% abundance and allow the experiment to reach a sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass of 100-200 meV at 90% C.L in a 3 year run. The SNO+ detector has ultra low backgrounds with 7000 tonnes of water shielding and self-shielding of the scintillator. Distillation and several other purification techniques will be used with the aim of achieving Borexino levels of backgrounds. The experiment is fully funded and data taking with light-water will commence in 2012 with scintillator data following in 2013.

A key component of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is the Davis Campus, which is in operation at the 4850-foot level (4300 m.w.e.) and currently hosts two main physics projects: the LUX dark matter experiment and the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR neutrinolessdouble-beta decay experiment. In addition, two low-background counters currently operate at the Davis Campus in support of current and future experiments. Expansion of the underground laboratory space is underway at the 4850L Ross Campus in order to maintain and enhance low- background assay capabilities as well as to host a unique nuclear astrophysics accelerator facility. Plans to accommodate other future experiments at SURF are also underway and include the next generation of direct-search dark matter experiments and the Fermilab-led international long- baseline neutrino program. Planning to understand the infrastructure developments necessary to accommodate these future projects is well advanced and in some cases have already started. SURF is a dedicated research facility with significant expansion capability.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The Majorana Demonstrator is an ultra-low background physics experiment searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge. The Majorana Parts Tracking Database is used to record the history of components used in the construction of the Demonstrator. The tracking implementation takes a novel approach based on the schema-free database technology CouchDB. Transportation, storage, and processes undergone by parts such as machining or cleaning are linked to part records. Tracking parts provide a great logistics benefit and an important quality assurance reference during construction. In addition, the location history of parts provides an estimate of their exposure to cosmic radiation. A web application for data entry and a radiation exposure calculator have been developed as tools for achieving the extreme radio-purity required for this rare decay search. },

	Abstract = {Neutrinoless double beta decay is a process that violates lepton number conservation. It is predicted to occur in extensions of the standard model of particle physics. This Letter reports the results from phase I of the Germanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy) searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of the isotope Ge76. Data considered in the present analysis have been collected between November 2011 and May 2013 with a total exposure of 21.6 kgâyr. A blind analysis is performed. The background index is about 1Ã10â2ââcounts/(keVâkgâyr) after pulse shape discrimination. No signal is observed and a lower limit is derived for the half-life of neutrinoless double beta decay of Ge76, T0Î½1/2>2.1Ã1025ââyr (90% C.L.). The combination with the results from the previous experiments with Ge76 yields T0Î½1/2>3.0Ã1025ââyr (90% C.L.).},

The impact that a direct observation of this exotic process would have on elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, and cosmology is profound. Now that neutrinos are known to have mass and experiments are becoming more sensitive, even the nonobservation of neutrinoless double beta decay will be useful. If the process is actually observed, we will immediately learn much about the neutrino. The status and discovery potential of proposed experiments are reviewed in this context, with significant emphasis on proposals favored by recent panel reviews. The importance of and challenges in the calculation of nuclear matrix elements that govern the decay are considered in detail. The increasing sensitivity of experiments and improvements in nuclear theory make the future exciting for this field at the interface of nuclear and particle physics.},

The calculation of the asymmetry in leptogenesis is intimately related to neutrino properties so that leptogenesis is also an important phenomenological tool to test the see-saw mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses and mixing and the underlying theory beyond the Standard Model. },

	Abstract = {We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG), beyond the cosmological constant scenario. We start with cases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering Taylor expansions of the equation of state, principal component analysis and parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar field. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly improve present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In addition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic acoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble constant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational lensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and for breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck and background data sets. All results that include only background parameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also change perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions appear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is \sim 2 sigma for Planck TT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials with a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when external data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB lensing.},

	Abstract = {We present a weak-lensing mass reconstruction of the interacting cluster 1E 0657-558, in which we detect both the main cluster and a subcluster. The subcluster is identified as a smaller cluster that has just undergone initial infall and pass-through of the primary cluster and has been previously identified in both optical surveys and X-ray studies. The X-ray gas has been separated from the galaxies by ram pressure-stripping during the pass-through. The detected mass peak is located between the X-ray peak and galaxy concentration, although the position is consistent with the galaxy centroid within the errors of the mass reconstruction. We find that the mass peak for the main cluster is in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxies and is offset from the X-ray halo at 3.4 Ï significance, and we determine that the mass-to-light ratios of the two components are consistent with those of relaxed clusters. The observed offsets of the lensing mass peaks from the peaks of the dominant visible mass component (the X-ray gas) directly demonstrate the presence, and dominance, of dark matter in this cluster. This proof of dark matter existence holds true even under the assumption of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND); based on the observed gravitational shear-optical light ratios and the mass peak-X-ray gas offsets, the dark matter component in a MOND regime would have a total mass that is at least equal to the baryonic mass of the system.},

Gauverein meeting in T{\"u}bingen.

Z{\"u}rich, Dec. 4, 1930

Physics Institute of the ETH

Z{\"u}rich

Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen,

As the bearer of these lines, to whom I graciously ask you to listen, will explain to you in more detail, because of the "wrong" statistics of the N- and Li-6 nuclei and the continuous beta spectrum, I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the "exchange theorem" (1) of statistics and the law of conservation of energy. Namely, the possibility that in the nuclei there could exist electrically neutral particles, which I will call neutrons, that have spin 1/2 and obey the exclusion principle and that further differ from light quanta in that they do not travel with the velocity of light. The mass of the neutrons should be of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass and in any event not larger than 0.01 proton mass. - The continuous beta spectrum would then make sense with the assumption that in beta decay, in addition to the electron, a neutron is emitted such that the sum of the energies of neutron and electron is constant.

Now it is also a question of which forces act upon neutrons. For me, the most likely model for the neutron seems to be, for wave-mechanical reasons (the bearer of these lines knows more), that the neutron at rest is a magnetic dipole with a certain moment Î¼. The experiments seem to require that the ionizing effect of such a neutron can not be bigger than the one of a gamma-ray, and then Î¼ is probably not allowed to be larger than e * (10 -13cm).

But so far I do not dare to publish anything about this idea, and trustfully turn first to you, dear radioactive people, with the question of how likely it is to find experimental evidence for such a neutron if it would have the same or perhaps a 10 times larger ability to get through [material] than a gamma-ray.

I admit that my remedy may seem almost improbable because one probably would have seen those neutrons, if they exist, for a long time. But nothing ventured, nothing gained, and the seriousness of the situation, due to the continuous structure of the beta spectrum, is illuminated by a remark of my honored predecessor, Mr Debye, who told me recently in Bruxelles: "Oh, It's better not to think about this at all, like new taxes." Therefore one should seriously discuss every way of rescue. Thus, dear radioactive people, scrutinize and judge. - Unfortunately, I cannot personally appear in T{\"u}bingen since I amindispensable here in Z{\"u}rich because of a ball on the night from December 6 to 7. With my best regards to you, and also to Mr. Back, your humble servant

	Abstract = {The recent development of large mass, low noise P-type point contact (PPC) high purity
germanium detectors has opened up a number of new opportunities for experiments in neu-
trino and astroparticle physics. Several of these experiments have been performed with the
earliest prototypes. They are described in this thesis. A measurement for the quenching
factor for sub-keV nuclear recoils in germanium detectors is presented. Also discussed is an
assessment of the low energy backgrounds at a nuclear power reactor along with the progress
that has been achieved towards a measurement of coherent neutrino-nuclear scattering. Us-
ing the brief exposure of the detector to a high flux of reactor neutrinos, a limit is placed on
the magnitude of a neutrino magnetic moment and a projected limit that can be achieved
with a more complete experiment is discussed. A limit is also placed on the magnitude of
a continuous energy deposition by reactor neutrinos in the germanium detector. Using the
low background data that were obtained at the reactor, limits on light WIMPs as well as
dark galactic pseudoscalars are presented, which constrain the physical explanation for a
claimed observation of dark matter by the DAMA collaboration. As PPC detectors have
been chosen as the preferred detector for the 60 kg Majorana demonstrator double beta
decay experiment, projected limits on light WIMPs and dark pseudoscalars are also pre-
sented. Finally, bounds are placed on the lifetime of the electron for ``invisible'' decays that
occur via eâ â Î½ Î½ Ì Î½ , and projected limits for such a search using the 60 kg Majorana eee
demonstrator are also presented.},

	Abstract = {The Majorana Collaboration is building the Majorana Demonstrator, a 60&#xa0;kg array of high purity germanium detectors housed in an ultra-low background shield at the Sanford Underground Laboratory in Lead, SD. The Majorana Demonstrator will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge while demonstrating the feasibility of a tonne-scale experiment. It may also carry out a dark matter search in the 1--10&#xa0;GeV/c2 mass range. We have found that customized Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors produced by Canberra have several desirable features for a neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment, including low electronic noise, excellent pulse shape analysis capabilities, and simple fabrication. We have deployed a customized BEGe, the Majorana Low-Background \{BEGe\} at Kimballton (MALBEK), in a low-background cryostat and shield at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility in Virginia. This paper will focus on the detector characteristics and measurements that can be performed with such a radiation detector in a low-background environment. },

	Abstract = {We study detection of MeV-range neutrinos through elastic scattering on nuclei and identification of the recoil energy. The very large value of the neutral-current cross section due to coherence indicates a detector would be relatively light and suggests the possibility of a true "neutrino observatory." The recoil energy which must be detected is very small (10-103 eV), however. We examine a realization in terms of the superconducting-grain idea, which appears, in principle, to be feasible through extension and extrapolation of currently known techniques. Such a detector could permit determination of the neutrino energy spectrum and should be insensitive to neutrino oscillations since it detects all neutrino types. Various applications and tests are discussed, including spallation sources, reactors, supernovas, and solar and terrestrial neutrinos. A preliminary estimate of the most difficult backgrounds is attempted.},

Observation of neutrinoless double-{$[$}bgr{$]$} decay (0{$[$}ngr{$]$}{$[$}bgr{$]$}{$[$}bgr{$]$}), a spontaneous transition that may occur in several candidate nuclei, would verify the Majorana nature of the neutrino and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum. Recent searches carried out with 76Ge (the GERDA experiment) and 136Xe (the KamLAND-Zen and EXO (Enriched Xenon Observatory)-200 experiments) have established the lifetime of this decay to be longer than 1025{$[$}thinsp{$]$}years, corresponding to a limit on the neutrino mass of 0.2-0.4{$[$}thinsp{$]$}electronvolts. Here we report new results from EXO-200 based on a large 136Xe exposure that represents an almost fourfold increase from our earlier published data sets. We have improved the detector resolution and revised the data analysis. The half-life sensitivity we obtain is 1.9{$[$}thinsp{$]$}{$[$}times{$]$}{$[$}thinsp{$]$}1025{$[$}thinsp{$]$}years, an improvement by a factor of 2.7 on previous EXO-200 results.

@article{PlanckXVI_2013,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (â â³ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ÎCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be Î¸â = (1.04147 $\pm$ 0.00062) Ã 10-2, Î©bh2 = 0.02205 $\pm$ 0.00028, Î©ch2 = 0.1199 $\pm$ 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 $\pm$ 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 $\pm$ 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Î©m = 0.315 $\pm$ 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ÎCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ÎCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 $\pm$ 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ÎCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 â² â â² 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

The pairing and residual interactions as well as the two-nucleon short-range correlations are for the first time derived from the same modern realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials, namely, from the charge-dependent Bonn potential (CD-Bonn) and the Argonne V18 potential. In a comparison with the traditional approach of using the Miller-Spencer Jastrow correlations, matrix elements for the 0Î½Î²Î² decay are obtained that are larger in magnitude. We analyze the differences among various two-nucleon correlations including those of the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM) and quantify the uncertainties in the calculated 0Î½Î²Î²-decay matrix elements.},

Combining CUORE-0 data with the 19.75~kgâyr exposure of 130Te from the Cuoricino experiment we obtain T0Î½1/2>4.0Ã1024 yr at 90%~C.L.~(Bayesian), the most stringent limit to date on this half-life. Using a range of nuclear matrix element estimates we interpret this as a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, mÎ²Î²<270 -- 760 meV.},

	Abstract = {A new type of radiation detector, a p-type modified electrode germanium diode, is presented. It is shown that the prototype displays, for the first time, a combination of features (mass, energy threshold and background expectation) required for a measurement of coherent neutrino--nucleus scattering in a nuclear reactor experiment. First results are presented from its calibration using sub-kiloelectronvolt nuclear recoils similar to those expected from reactor antineutrinos or light WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) beyond the reach of present detectors. The device hybridizes the mass and energy resolution of a conventional HPGe coaxial gamma spectrometer with the low electronic noise and threshold of a small x-ray semiconductor detector, also displaying an intrinsic ability to distinguish multiple-site from single-site particle interactions. The present performance of the prototype and possible further improvements are discussed, as well as other applications for this new type of device in neutrino and astroparticle physics (double-beta decay, neutrino magnetic moment and novel WIMP searches).},

	Abstract = {Weak-interaction and nuclear-structure aspects of double beta decay are reviewed. Starting from effective electroweak lagrangians, decay rates for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of the nuclear double beta decay transitions are defined and second-order perturbative expressions for the nuclear decay amplitudes are given. Nuclear matrix elements of the relevant operators are presented, as extracted from data and from shell-model and \{QRPA\} calculations as well as from other theoretical approximations. The analysis is performed both for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of the decay. The expressions for ground-state-to-ground-state and ground-state-to-excited-state transitions are presented.

The relevance of single-beta-decay transitions feeding some of the nuclei where double-beta-decay transitions occur is pointed out. The systematics of various phase-space factors and extracted matrix elements is presented. },

	Abstract = {The neutrino, an elementary particle, has been the subject of experimental investigation for over 50 years. Recent experiments have shown that neutrinos have mass and oscillate, but questions about fundamental properties of the neutrino remain. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay could determine whether lepton number is violated, discover whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle, and provide information about the absolute scale of neutrino mass. The MAJORANA Collaboration will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of germanium-76 in an array of germanium detectors. Previous experiments indicate that the half life of this decay mode is greater than 1025 years. To be sensitive to this rate, MAJORANA must construct an ultra-low-background detector. MAJORANA is building the DEMONSTRATOR, a 40-kg detector array, at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76-Ge would produce 76-Se and two electrons with 2039 keV of energy. The physics reach of the DEMONSTRATOR will be determined by the background count rate in a 4-keV energy region surrounding the 2039-keV Q-value. MAJORANA has a background goal of less than three counts in the energy region of interest per tonne-year of DEMONSTRATOR exposure. Projections of the DEMONSTRATOR's sensitivity are determined from a background energy-spectrum model based on material assay data and Monte Carlo simulation results. Understanding and minimization of backgrounds is critical to the success of the DEMONSTRATOR. MAJORANA Collaborators operate a low-background detector in a shielded environment at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility near Ripplemeade, Virginia. The contents of the detector cryostat are well known, making it a good candidate for testing the MAJORANA background model. This dissertation describes the creation of a background energy- spectrum model for the Kimballton detector. Energy spectra measured with the detector at Kimballton are compared to results of the background model, and implications for the DEMONSTRATOR are explored.},

	Abstract = {Neutrinoless double-beta (0Î½Î²Î²) decay is a hypothesized process where in some even-even nuclei it might be possible for two neutrons to simultaneously decay into two protons and two electrons without emitting neutrinos. This is possible only if neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. fermions that are their own antiparticles. Neutrinos being Majorana particles would explicitly violate lepton number conservation, and might play a role in the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would also provide complementary information related to neutrino masses. The Majorana Collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, with a total of 40-kg Germanium detectors, to search for the 0Î½Î²Î² decay of (76)Ge and to demonstrate a background rate at or below 3 counts/(ROIÂ·tÂ·y) in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) around the 2039 keV Q-value for (76)Ge 0Î½Î²Î² decay.
