\abstract{%
My thesis will cover my work directly on the \MJ\ \MJDemo\ and the R\&D project I am starting at UW. The first topic will include issues in the construction of the experiment, especially the development work I did on low-background signal cable connectors, and analysis methods I am developing and implementing, including optimum filtering and frequency-based tagging of detector noise.  The main portion of my thesis, however, will focus on a project I am beginning now, an internal scanning system for P-type point contact germanium detectors. Using this setup, I will be able to characterize how different styles of detector respond to alpha particles and low-energy x-rays.  This will help us understand the \MJDemo 's alpha backgrounds and inform the choice of technology for a future ton-scale neutrinoless double beta decay experiment.
