@phdthesis{BarbeauThesis,
	Abstract = {The recent development of large mass, low noise P-type point contact (PPC) high purity
germanium detectors has opened up a number of new opportunities for experiments in neu-
trino and astroparticle physics. Several of these experiments have been performed with the
earliest prototypes. They are described in this thesis. A measurement for the quenching
factor for sub-keV nuclear recoils in germanium detectors is presented. Also discussed is an
assessment of the low energy backgrounds at a nuclear power reactor along with the progress
that has been achieved towards a measurement of coherent neutrino-nuclear scattering. Us-
ing the brief exposure of the detector to a high flux of reactor neutrinos, a limit is placed on
the magnitude of a neutrino magnetic moment and a projected limit that can be achieved
with a more complete experiment is discussed. A limit is also placed on the magnitude of
a continuous energy deposition by reactor neutrinos in the germanium detector. Using the
low background data that were obtained at the reactor, limits on light WIMPs as well as
dark galactic pseudoscalars are presented, which constrain the physical explanation for a
claimed observation of dark matter by the DAMA collaboration. As PPC detectors have
been chosen as the preferred detector for the 60 kg Majorana demonstrator double beta
decay experiment, projected limits on light WIMPs and dark pseudoscalars are also pre-
sented. Finally, bounds are placed on the lifetime of the electron for ``invisible'' decays that
occur via e− → ν ν ̄ ν , and projected limits for such a search using the 60 kg Majorana eee
demonstrator are also presented.},

	Abstract = {The Majorana Demonstrator is an array of natural and enriched high purity germanium detectors that will search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge and perform a search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with masses below 10 GeV. As part of the Majorana research and development efforts, we have deployed a modified, low-background broad energy germanium detector at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility. With its sub-keV energy threshold, this detector is sensitive to potential non-Standard Model physics, including interactions with WIMPs. We discuss the backgrounds present in the WIMP region of interest and explore the impact of slow surface event contamination when searching for a WIMP signal.

	Abstract = {The Majorana Collaboration is building the Majorana Demonstrator, a 60&#xa0;kg array of high purity germanium detectors housed in an ultra-low background shield at the Sanford Underground Laboratory in Lead, SD. The Majorana Demonstrator will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76Ge while demonstrating the feasibility of a tonne-scale experiment. It may also carry out a dark matter search in the 1--10&#xa0;GeV/c2 mass range. We have found that customized Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detectors produced by Canberra have several desirable features for a neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment, including low electronic noise, excellent pulse shape analysis capabilities, and simple fabrication. We have deployed a customized BEGe, the Majorana Low-Background \{BEGe\} at Kimballton (MALBEK), in a low-background cryostat and shield at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility in Virginia. This paper will focus on the detector characteristics and measurements that can be performed with such a radiation detector in a low-background environment. },

@article{Drukier1984,
	Abstract = {We study detection of MeV-range neutrinos through elastic scattering on nuclei and identification of the recoil energy. The very large value of the neutral-current cross section due to coherence indicates a detector would be relatively light and suggests the possibility of a true "neutrino observatory." The recoil energy which must be detected is very small (10-103 eV), however. We examine a realization in terms of the superconducting-grain idea, which appears, in principle, to be feasible through extension and extrapolation of currently known techniques. Such a detector could permit determination of the neutrino energy spectrum and should be insensitive to neutrino oscillations since it detects all neutrino types. Various applications and tests are discussed, including spallation sources, reactors, supernovas, and solar and terrestrial neutrinos. A preliminary estimate of the most difficult backgrounds is attempted.},

Observation of neutrinoless double-{$[$}bgr{$]$} decay (0{$[$}ngr{$]$}{$[$}bgr{$]$}{$[$}bgr{$]$}), a spontaneous transition that may occur in several candidate nuclei, would verify the Majorana nature of the neutrino and constrain the absolute scale of the neutrino mass spectrum.

@article{PlanckXVI_2013,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (ℓ ≳ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ∗ = (1.04147 $\pm$ 0.00062) × 10-2, Ωbh2 = 0.02205 $\pm$ 0.00028, Ωch2 = 0.1199 $\pm$ 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 $\pm$ 0.0073, respectively(note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 $\pm$ 1.2) km s-1 Mpc-1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ωm = 0.315 $\pm$ 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity isinsensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r0.002< 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find Neff = 3.30 $\pm$ 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13-0.10+0.13. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ΛCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 ≲ ℓ ≲ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

	Abstract = {A self-consistent calculation of nuclear matrix elements of the neutrinoless double-beta decays (0νββ) of Ge76, Se82, Zr96, Mo100, Cd116, Te128, Te130, and Xe136 is presented in the framework of the renormalized quasiparticle random phase approximation (RQRPA) and the standard QRPA. The pairing and residual interactions as well as the two-nucleon short-range correlations are for the first time derived from the same modern realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials, namely, from the charge-dependent Bonn potential (CD-Bonn) and the Argonne V18 potential. In a comparison with the traditional approach of using the Miller-Spencer Jastrow correlations, matrix elements for the 0νββ decay are obtained that are larger in magnitude. We analyze the differences among various two-nucleon correlations including those of the unitary correlation operator method (UCOM) and quantify the uncertainties in the calculated 0νββ-decay matrix elements.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of a search for neutrinoless double-beta decay in a 9.8~kg⋅yr exposure of 130Te using a bolometric detector array, CUORE-0. The characteristic detector energy resolution and background level in the region of interest are 5.1$\pm$0.3 keV FWHM and 0.058$\pm$0.004(stat.)$\pm$0.002(syst.)~counts/(keV⋅kg⋅yr), respectively. The median 90%~C.L. lower-limit sensitivity of the experiment is 2.9×1024 yr and surpasses the sensitivity of previous searches. We find no evidence for neutrinoless double-beta decay of 130Te and place a Bayesian lower bound on the decay half-life, T0ν1/2>~2.7×1024 yr at 90%~C.L. Combining CUORE-0 data with the 19.75~kg⋅yr exposure of 130Te from the Cuoricino experiment we obtain T0ν1/2>4.0×1024 yr at 90%~C.L.~(Bayesian), the most stringent limit to date on this half-life. Using a range of nuclear matrix element estimates we interpret this as a limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass, mββ<270 -- 760 meV.},

	Abstract = {A new type of radiation detector, a p-type modified electrode germanium diode, is presented. It is shown that the prototype displays, for the first time, a combination of features (mass, energy threshold and background expectation) required for a measurement of coherent neutrino--nucleus scattering in a nuclear reactor experiment. First results are presented from its calibration using sub-kiloelectronvolt nuclear recoils similar to those expected from reactor antineutrinos or light WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) beyond the reach of present detectors. The device hybridizes the mass and energy resolution of a conventional HPGe coaxial gamma spectrometer with the low electronic noise and threshold of a small x-ray semiconductor detector, also displaying an intrinsic ability to distinguish multiple-site from single-site particle interactions. The present performance of the prototype and possible further improvements are discussed, as well as other applications for this new type of device in neutrino and astroparticle physics (double-beta decay, neutrino magnetic moment and novel WIMP searches).},

	Abstract = {Weak-interaction and nuclear-structure aspects of double beta decay are reviewed. Starting from effective electroweak lagrangians, decay rates for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of the nuclear double beta decay transitions are defined and second-order perturbative expressions for the nuclear decay amplitudes are given. Nuclear matrix elements of the relevant operators are presented, as extracted from data and from shell-model and \{QRPA\} calculations as well as from other theoretical approximations. The analysis is performed both for the two-neutrino and neutrinoless modes of the decay. The expressions for ground-state-to-ground-state and ground-state-to-excited-state transitions are presented. Updated experimental and theoretical information on β−β− decays in 48Ca, 76Ge, 82Se, 96Zr, 100Mo, 116Cd, 124Sn, 128Te, 130Te, 136Xe, 150Nd, and on β+β+, β+ \{EC\} and double \{EC\} decays in 78Kr, 92Mo, 96Ru, 106Cd, 124Xe, 130Ba, 136Ce is analyzed and compared with theoretical results. The relevance of single-beta-decay transitions feeding some of the nuclei where double-beta-decay transitions occur is pointed out. The systematics of various phase-space factors and extracted matrix elements is presented. },

@phdthesis{SchubertThesis,
	Abstract = {The neutrino, an elementary particle, has been the subject of experimental investigation for over 50 years. Recent experiments have shown that neutrinos have mass and oscillate, but questions about fundamental properties of the neutrino remain. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay could determine whether lepton number is violated, discover whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle, and provide information about the absolute scale of neutrino mass. The MAJORANA Collaboration will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of germanium-76 in an array of germanium detectors. Previous experiments indicate that the half life of this decay mode is greater than 1025 years. To be sensitive to this rate, MAJORANA must construct an ultra-low-background detector. MAJORANA is building the DEMONSTRATOR, a 40-kg detector array, at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The neutrinoless double-beta decay of 76-Ge would produce 76-Se and two electrons with 2039 keV of energy. The physics reach of the DEMONSTRATOR will be determined by the background count rate in a 4-keV energy region surrounding the 2039-keV Q-value. MAJORANA has a background goal of less than three counts in the energy region of interest per tonne-year of DEMONSTRATOR exposure. Projections of the DEMONSTRATOR's sensitivity are determined from a background energy-spectrum model based on material assay data and Monte Carlo simulation results. Understanding and minimization of backgrounds is critical to the success of the DEMONSTRATOR. MAJORANA Collaborators operate a low-background detector in a shielded environment at the Kimballton Underground Research Facility near Ripplemeade, Virginia. The contents of the detector cryostat are well known, making it a good candidate for testing the MAJORANA background model. This dissertation describes the creation of a background energy- spectrum model for the Kimballton detector. Energy spectra measured with the detector at Kimballton are compared to results of the background model, and implications for the DEMONSTRATOR are explored.},

	Abstract = {Neutrinoless double-beta (0νββ) decay is a hypothesized process where in some even-even nuclei it might be possible for two neutrons to simultaneously decay into two protons and two electrons without emitting neutrinos. This is possible only if neutrinos are Majorana particles, i.e. fermions that are their own antiparticles. Neutrinos being Majorana particles would explicitly violate lepton number conservation, and might play a role in the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would also provide complementary information related to neutrino masses. The Majorana Collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, with a total of 40-kg Germanium detectors, to search for the 0νββ decay of (76)Ge and to demonstrate a background rate at or below 3 counts/(ROI·t·y) in the 4 keV region of interest (ROI) around the 2039 keV Q-value for (76)Ge 0νββ decay.

	Abstract = {The Majorana Demonstrator is a planned 40 kg array of Germanium detectors intended to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a tonne-scale experiment that will seek neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) in (76)Ge. Such an experiment would require backgrounds of less than 1 count/tonne-year in the 4 keV region of interest around the 2039 keV Q-value of the ββ decay. Designing low-noise electronics, which must be placed in close proximity to the detectors, presents a challenge to reaching this background target. This paper will discuss the Majorana collaboration's solutions to some of these challenges.},
